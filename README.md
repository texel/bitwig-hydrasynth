# Bitwig HYDRASYNTH controller script

This is a controller script for the ASM Hydrasynth, that allows
you to use it as an MPE controller. Only poly aftertouch is supported.

This will allow you to record note pressure expressions from your
Hydrasynth into Bitwig, and play them back out via your Hydrasynth.

You can also use the Hydrasynth as a controller for other synths
that support polyphonic aftertouch, such as the Novation Peak/Summit.

## Setup
